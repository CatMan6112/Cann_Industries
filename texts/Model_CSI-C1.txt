Developed and deployed by Cann Space Industries (subsidiary of Cann Industries), the C1 model is provided complementary to all SDC marine vessels. There are currently UNKNOWN other C1 units in use. Powered by a high-capacity rechargeable power bank, this model’s primary directive is to protect the vessel it’s currently deployed on from rogue CSI units, such as the X1 or X1-0 units. The C1 model has a weapon compatibility module built in, with over two thousand different weapons that the unit is able to use effectively. Due to its finite energy supply, a modern language model has been excluded from this unit, instead using a Cann Industries–approved preprogrammed language dataset, which offers a high boost in understanding and a decline in misunderstandings.
