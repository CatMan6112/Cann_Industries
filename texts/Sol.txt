The Sol System, also known as the Solar System, is the gravitationally bound system of planets orbiting the star Sol. The system consists of eight major planets with numerous other satellites, the planets being Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune. Larger of the non-planetary bodies bound to Sol are the satellites such as Pluto, Makemake and Haumea, but are considered dwarf planets. The Sol System was formed 4.6 billion years ago following the gravitational collapse of an interstellar dust cloud. While typically the collapse of a dust cloud would lead to the formation of only one star or a number of asteroids, Sol retained a protoplanetary disk after forming which gradually coalesced into forming each of the eight planets known to humanity today, including their homeworld, Earth.

The Sol System is divided into three regions - the Inner System, comprised of Sol and the inner terrestrial planets, separated by the Asteroid Belt from the Outer System, with the Asteroid Belt and the gas giants. The furthest and final region of the Sol System is the Kuiper-Oort Region, consisting of the Kuiper Belt, a large system of asteroids similar to the inner Asteroid Belt, and the Oort Cloud, a vast cloud of debris and plantesimals 200,000 astronomical units away from Sol. The Oort Cloud is considered the end of the Sol System as it is where Sol's gravitational pull loses effect. The dwarf planets of Pluto, Makemake and Haumea are within the Kuiper-Oort Region.

Of the eight planets in the Sol System, four are thoroughly inhabited, hosting permanent populations and settlements, those being Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter and its Galilean moons. Other planets in the Sol System, such as the outer gas giants, are colonised but do not possess a large enough population, and therefore are not considered inhabited.
