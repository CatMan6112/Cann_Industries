The Sol Defence Corps (SDC) is the expeditionary and space warfare armed forces of the United Nations' military components and forms the main armed forces component of extraterrestrial human operations. Its function is to police, defend and monitor the Sol system from any foreign threats as well as initiate expeditionary efforts to other star systems in the form of the Final Frontier Project. Personnel in the Sol Defence Corps comprise the Navy, the principle entity of the Sol Defence Corps enabling all operations in space with its large fleet of starships, the Aviation Corps, the small craft force of the SDC fleeting a number of fighters, shuttles and other small craft, and the the Marine Corps, the main infantry force of the Sol Defence Corps, with different ranking structures for each.

The Navy consists of approximately 5.3 million personnel, including both enlisted personnel and commissioned officers. Recent calculations place the total number of Marine Corps personnel at approximately 2.1 million, and the Aviation Corps at roughly 1 million. In addition to the three core wings, roughly 3.7 million personnel are held to serve in either the Reserve or Auxiliary Forces.

As a United Nations proponent force, the SDC is made of personnel from backgrounds all over the globe and even over the colonies as well. Tracing its traditions and customs back mainly to that of the United States Navy and Royal Navy, of which the SDC received a large amount of initial funding from, the Corps prides itself on combining the traditions of the oldest military type in the world, a sailing navy, with that of the newest warfare region humanity has ever encountered: space.
