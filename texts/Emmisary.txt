The SDCN Emissary (registry HCR-146) is an Ambassador-class heavy cruiser in service with the Sol Defence Corps as a flagship of the Final Frontier Project.

Constructed in partnership with the AXIOM Corporation and numerous other sponsors, the ship features the latest technologies and features available to the United Nations. The ship itself is designed for long-term habitation, and as a result is built rather luxuriously, featuring plenty of amenities as well as clean and lavish design to appeal to the senses, while simultaneously still being functional at its duties. It boasts many amenities, including a gymnasium, pool, recreation room, two bars and lounges, and a library. Its construction features carpeted floors, padded walls, and a spacious interior optimized for extended living away from home.

As one of the flagships of the Final Frontier Project, the Emissary is designed for exploration and scientific research duties, being equipped with a state-of-the-art laboratory complex as well as a bleeding-edge FTL drive and lumicom array. As of 2117, the Emissary is currently deployed to Avalon as part of an extended research mission to survey its anomalies and chart its surface.
